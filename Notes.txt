Notes:
General: Trying to stay 20m below max alt

WP 11 and 12 are in 	Yellow zone - max 670m AMSL
Wp 18 is last in 	Pink zone - 120m AGL
WP 19 is first in 	Cyan zone - max 1188m AMSL
WP 20 is last in	"
WP 22 is last in 	Blue zone - max 1493m AMSL
Rest is in Purple zone - max 1798m AMSL


QNH is ~60m higher than GPS


Climbing at 1.5 m/s, terrain height is >500m


Min AGL was just over 200 m (non QNH), so about 140m if we're following QNH

Zone	Alt lim		Max ground (100m height)
Yellow	670		570
Cyan	1188	 	1088
Blue	1493		1393
Purple	1798		1698


Frame: Abs(AMSL) = 0, Rel(Home) = 3, AGL = 10




even with the ottano's max roll, it's like the thing turns on a dime

climb rates are slow, though.


did it make the 1493 border? (wp 43)
and the 1188 border (wp 47)


did it go back up before going down for agl?
